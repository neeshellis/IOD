Mini-Project #1
The first mini-project is designed to cover HTML/CSS/JS learned in the first 4 modules. The exercise on slide 98 of Module 4 is a good basic guide for the kind of thing that is required. Ideally the app will include multiple pages, some navigation, some interaction with an external data source, and include techniques such as animation, graphs, icons, fonts, bootstrap, etc.
Here are some questions for the students to cover during their presentations to make sure everything is covered:
What was your requirements gathering and design process? Was it useful/successful? Give a high level overview of your application and its features Where does its data come from (external/internal APIs)?How does the back end process this data? How can the user interact with this data? What JS techniques have you used (eg. objects, arrays, DOM functions, loops, functions)?What external tools/libraries have you used (eg. bootstrap/axios/charts)? How? Why?What kinds of HTML elements have you used (eg. tables, forms, divs, lists, headings, menus, videos, images)?What kinds of CSS features have you used (eg. animations, backgrounds, fonts, colours, flexbox, grid)?How might you extend the features of your application in future?
